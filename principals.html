                <p id="principal1_text">The thing with flags is that they are meant to be seen from a distance and overlooking a important object.
                    They thus cannot be overly complex, since those complexities will make the flag from a distance seem blurry.
                    <br> A good rule of thumb is "less is more." If you have an overly complex flag, try to find the parts that seem important
                    and highlight them in your flag.
                    <br> Also, if you are designing a flag, it's recommended to draw them on a 3 inch by 5 inch piece of paper, since that 
                    is how most people see them (from a distance).

                        <p class="Good_Example_Text"> The Flag is a good example of simplicity. It simplifies the Seal of Amsterdam (shown 
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Amsterdam#/media/File:Februaristakingvlag.svg">here</a>) into 
                        its most distinguisable elements (Red and x's). As a pretty badass flag, it has a life of its own in patriotic merchandise and 
                        sports teams.

                        <p class="Bad_Example_Text"> The Flag of West Virginia is overly complex. Its seal is too ornate and small, also also has too many
                            details to be understandable at a distance. It's nearly indistinguishable from a distance compared to other US state flags.

                    They cannot both be too simple or too complex. Each flag should always have a least one symbol that it can imporate into its design. That symbolism can be 
                    represented in small things, such as a specific shade of color, or in larger items, such as the flag's shape or imagry. 
                    <br>
                    Good flags ususally have 1, 2, or 3 interesting bits of symbolism and that are used coehesively. 
                    <br>
                    Good flags' symbolism is usually often stylized and made more abstract.

                            Both the color and direction of the stripes of the flag are important aspects to it. 
                            It's simple and symbolic of the country, one of whose main exports are wheat.

                        <p class="Bad_Example_Text"> Even though the green color of the flag was chosen for it's Islamic symbolism, its monocolor design is 
                            too simple to represent one country and if the flag is in  greyscale (as in newsprint), it means absolutely nothing. Kind of fitting
                            for a dictatorship.

                <h1 class="principal_title"> Use 2-3 Basic Colors</h1>
                <h3 class="principal_subtitle">don't use too many different or clashing colors</h3>
                <p id="principal3_text">A flag should not have too many colors. Unless its object is its multicolorednes (as in the 
                    <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Gay_Pride_Flag.svg">pride flag</a>), having too many colors
                makes the flag confusing and sometimes even clashing with itself.
                <br>
                A good rule of thumb is to have only 2 or 3 basic flag colors in a flag, and to only use those basic colors (red, blue,
                green, black, yellow, and white). Don't make to colors clash and also divide darks with lights and vice versa. 
                <br>
                A flag designer should be mindful of cost, too. Having an overly colored flag can make the flag too costly for most
                people to buy.

                <p id="principal4_text">Flags, above all, are meant to be symbolic. When one writes letters or dumps a seal on a flag, 
                    it's not just unimaginative and lazy but also hard to read at a distance, sew together, or even color. When a flag has to have
                lettering on it, its symbolism has failed.
                <br>
                    As a rule of thumb, never put any seal or lettering on a flag (there are some 
                    <a href="https://ideas.ted.com/7-fantastic-flags-that-break-every-design-rule/">really cool exceptions</a> though).

                    best designs have already been taken. However, a flag's symbols, shapes, and colors can recall
                    other flags' power and imagry.
